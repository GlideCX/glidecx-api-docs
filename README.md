# üëã Welcome to GlideCX's REST API

REST API allows you to access your GlideCX data. Request methods are used in accordance with HTTP:

* GET is used to read one or more entities;
* POST is used to create or update entities;
* DELETE is used to delete entities;
* Responses use standard HTTP codes.

Before you start using the API, read through the following five basics üëá 

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Base API Domain

GlideCX's API is provided on the following HTTPS-only domain:

```https://api.glidecx.com/user/api/v1/```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication

You should authenticate all your HTTP requests to GlideCX's API with the help of your API key.

To get your API key, go to Account ‚Üí API Keys and copy your API Key from there.

[Screenshot coming soon]

```Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY```

You don't need to do any extra manipulations with your API key. It is permanent and never expires until reset from the dashboard.

Make sure you pass the entire key without any spaces or extra symbols.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Rate limiting

In order to protect Cloutly from API traffic spikes that could put our database at risk we utilise rate-limiting. When you get rate-limited, you will start receiving ***429 Too Many Requests*** HTTP errors in response to your requests.

The default overall requests limit is ***200 per minute***

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Errors

Depending on the exact method, you can get one of the following error status codes and responses: 

### 400 Bad Request

The request could not be understood by GlideCX's server due to malformed syntax or invalid attribute value. DO NOT repeat such requests without modifications.

### 401 Unauthorized

This means that something is wrong with your API key or it's not added to the request headers at all. Make sure you pass it as described in the ***Authentication*** section above.

### 404 Not Found

We were unable to find anything matching your request.

### 429 Too Many Requests

You reached a rate-limit of 100 API calls per minute.
